# RIP-ROUTING

IN this project we
Network Design and Testing

Implemented a multi-router network topology with specific interface configurations.
Configured RIP routing protocol to establish communication between routers.
Conducted network connectivity tests to validate route propagation.
Simulated network failures by blocking traffic between specific routers.
Implemented security measures by configuring custom MOTD banners on routers.

We also discovered that RIP Routing seizes to function  after 17 hops.
